<!-- <h1></h1> is a heading tag, 1-6 where 1 is largest and 6 is smallest by default-->
<!-- The <em></em> tag allows us to 'emphasize' text wrapped within the tags-->

<!-- 
<h1>Hello World</h1>
<em>content</em> -->

<!-- Elements are often setup in a nested form where the outer element is the parent
and the 'nested' inner elements are the children.
Below is an example of a parent div element with a child h1 element-->

<!-- 
<div>
    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
</div> -->


<!-- This bdo tag stands for bi-directional override
The attribute dir is set to 'rtl' (right to left)
The result is the html will be rendered from right to left within the tag
This would be a way to 'reverse a string' using html-->

<!--<bdo dir="rtl">uoy htiw eb ecrof eht yam</bdo>-->

 
 <!-- CSS CASCADING STYLE SHEETS-->

<!--Example of an inline style (styling within the line the tag is in)
You usually want to avoid this, extremely hard to override. Reference Specificity:
Inline: 1000 points of specificity
ID selectors: 100 points of specificity
Class selectors: 10 points of specificity
Element Selectors: 1 point of specificity

When resolving conflicting styles, the selector with the higher specificity value takes precedence
over those with lower values. If multiple selectors have the same specificity
the last one defined in the stylesheet will be applied.

It's important to note that specificity points are cumulative when multiple selectors are combined. 

For example, if you have an element targeted with both an ID selector and a class selector
the specificity would be 110 (100 for the ID + 10 for the class).-->

<!--Inline styling example-->

 <!-- <html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
      <p style="color: red;">Paragraph</p>
    </body>
  </html> -->
 
<!--1000 points of specificity, very hard to override-->

<!--Internal styling example:
Similar to using a external style sheet and linking it
This example targets the <p> element-->
 
<!-- <html>
  <head>
    <style>
    p { color: red; }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html> -->

<!--1 point of specificity, very easy to override-->

<!--External style sheet (using a link)
By using a <link> we can access our styling from outside of our html
This allows the html to be more readable and the styling sheet can be
referenced for anything related to the style of our content-->

<!--Our href is the name of the file that contains our styling-->
<!-- <html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Paragraph</p>
  </body>
</html> -->

<!--Looking at our style sheet, we again are targeting an element <p>
    So the above styling will also have 1 point of specificity-->

<!--Basic Structure of CSS
selector { property: value }

Let's say I wanted to center some text on a line

<h5>Text</h5>

Apply CSS <h5 style="text-align: center;">Text</h5>
In this case, the h5 is the selector, text-align is the property, and center is the value.

Look at styles.css to see how this was applied-->
<!-- 
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Paragraph</p>
    <h5> Some text to be centered</h5>
  </body>
</html> -->

<!-- BOX MODEL
Check out the boxmodel.png or boxmodel2 for visuals

Margin: The margin is the space outside the border. It creates the spacing between elements on the page.
Margins can be set using CSS properties like 
margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left.

Border: The border surrounds the padding area and separates it from the margin. 
It can be styled and given a specific width using CSS properties like 
border-width, border-style, and border-color.

Padding: The padding is the space between the content area and the border.
It provides visual spacing inside the element. Padding can be set using CSS properties like 
padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left.

Content: The content area represents the actual content of the element, such as text, images, or other HTML elements. 
It is the innermost part of the box and is enclosed by padding, border, and margin.
-->


<!--Internal Styling-->


<!-- <style>
    div {
      border: 6px solid #949599;
      height: 200px;
      margin: 20px;
      padding: 20px;
      width: 200px;
    }
  </style>
  <div>Hello</div> -->

  <!--CSS property breakdown:
border: 6px solid #949599;: 
This line sets the border properties of the <div> element. 
It assigns a solid border of 6 pixels in width with the color #949599. 
The border property affects the appearance of the border around the content area.

height: 200px;: 
This line sets the height of the <div> element to 200 pixels.
The height property determines the height of the content area of the element, excluding padding, border, and margin.

margin: 20px;: This line sets a margin of 20 pixels on all sides of the <div> element. 
The margin property defines the space outside the border. 
In this case, it creates a space of 20 pixels around the entire element.

padding: 20px;: 
This line sets a padding of 20 pixels on all sides of the <div> element. 
The padding property defines the space between the content and the border. 
In this case, it adds a 20-pixel space between the content and the border.

width: 200px;: 
This line sets the width of the <div> element to 200 pixels. 
The width property determines the width of the content area of the element
excluding padding, border, and margin.-->

<!--External Styling (See styles.css)-->

<!-- <html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>Hello</div>
  </body>
</html> -->


<!-- Boiler plate: To create quick starter code in VS Code you can
Simply type "!" and press Tab once and it should generate a generic HTML boilerplate
That will include DOCTYPE html, a head, some meta tags, title, and a body to quickly get you started -->


<!-- <!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Code Platoon!</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    
</body>
</html> -->

<!--Some General format info-->

<!-- 
All HTML documents start with a Doctype declaration.
This let's the browser know everything that follows is part of an HTML document. 
Doctype always sits at the top and it does not have a closing tag.

Next comes our html tag. This wraps around the entire document. Notice the closing html tag at the very bottom. 
It's common in HTML to nest tags within tags. We'll be seeing this a lot.

The next tag is the head tag.
The head of the html document contains all the links and meta data the page needs. 
Nothing in the head tag will appear on the final page. 
Some things that can go in the head include: links to style sheets, meta tags that provide data for screen readers or for SEO.
The title tag in the head is what gets displayed in the browser tab.

After the head tag comes the body. This is the meat of the document.
Everything nested inside the body tag is what will show up on the actual page.
In this case it's just our <h1> from before. -->
